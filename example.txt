# The Weeknd - Out of Time

# There can be any number of names

== Name 1, Name 2, Name 3, Name 4

Yeah, yeah

The last few months, I've been working on me, baby
There's so much trauma in my life
I've been so cold to the ones who loved me, baby
I look back now and I realize

And I remember when I held you
You begged me with your drowning eyes to stay
And I regret I didn't tell you
Now I can't keep you from loving him, you made up your mind

Say I love you, girl, but I'm out of time
Say I'm there for you, but I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
Said, I'm too late to make you mine, out of time (ah)

If he mess' up just a little, baby, you know my line
If you don't trust him a little, then come right back, girl, come right back
Give me one chance, just a little, baby, I'll treat you right
And I'll love you like I should've loved you all the time

And I remember when I held you (held you, baby)
You begged me with your drowning eyes to stay (never again, baby)
And I regret I didn't tell you
Now I can't keep you from loving him, you made up your mind (uh)

Say I love you, girl, but I'm out of time
Say I'm there for you, but I'm out of time (no)
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time (hey)
Said, I'm too late to make you mine, out of time (ah)

Ooh-ooh-ooh, singing (out of time)
Said, I had you to myself, but I'm (out of time)
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
But I'm too late to make you mine, out of time (uh)
Out of time, out of time

Don't you dare touch that dial
Because like the song says, you are out of time
You're almost there, but don't panic
There's still more music to come before you're completely engulfed in the blissful embrace of that little light you see in the distance

Soon you'll be healed, forgiven, and refreshed, free from all trauma, pain, guilt, and shame
You may even forget your own name, but before you dwell in that house forever
Here's 30 minutes of easy listening to some slow tracks, on 103.5 Dawn FM

# Cindy Lauper - Time After Time

== Name 5, Name 6

Lying in my bed, I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after

Sometimes you picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, I can't hear
What you've said
Then you say, "go slow"
And I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I will be waiting
Time after time

After my picture fades and darkness has
Turned to gray
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen from deep inside (deep inside)
And the drum beats out of time

If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I will be waiting
Time after time
Time after time

I've got a suitcase of memories that I almost left behind
Time after time
Time, time, time
But you say to go slow but I fall behind
Time after time after time (after time, oh)
