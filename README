== DESCRIPTION ==

This is a Python script for splitting a running text into multiple pages that
can be printed onto overhead pages and, when placed on top of one another,
results in the full text again.

The script takes a file with texts and produces a LaTeX file, which is then
transformed into a corresponding PDF. Hence TeX Live or something similar needs
to be installed.

There is a Makefile containing a recipe on how to build the PDF.

== HOW TO RUN ==

$ make example.pdf
